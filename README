_______________________CHATCLIENT and CHATSERVE, Written by Adam Sunderman for OSU CS-372____________________________

Credits: ChatClient program written with lots of help from "Beej's Guide To Network Programming"
								http://beej.us/guide/bgnet/
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Notes: chatserver and chatclient have been tested on OSU servers flip1, flip2 and flip3 using ports 30020-30022     
	   as well as my home network using localhost and various other ports. 
____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
chatserve:
	chatserve is a python program that waits on a port number specified at launch for
	incoming TCP connections from chatclient. Once a connection has been established 
	chatserve will wait for the initial message from the client containing the users
	'handle'. From here communication will continue with chatclient on a back and forth
	basis until chatclient closes the connection or until the chatserve user types '\quit'.
	Typing '\quit' will only close the current connection, chatserve will continue to wait 
	on the specified port until the users presses control+c. chatserve will only accept and send
	messages that are 500 charachters in length. Any excess charachters will be discarded.

	To run chatserve:  ./chatserve [PORT]
	         Example:  ./chatserve 30021

chatclient.c:
	chatclient is a c program that connects to a port number and hostname specified at launch 
	for a TCP connections to chatserve. Once chatclient has begun the user will be instructed to enter
	a 'handle' of 10 or less characters. This will repeat until the resriction is met. Once a 'handle'
	has been established the connection will be made/attempted. If succesful the user will be prompted
	to enter an initial message for chatserve and communications will commence. From here communication 
	will continue with chatclient on a back and forth basis until chatserver closes the connection or 
	until the chatclient user types '\quit'. Typing '\quit' will only close the current connection and 
	close the chatclient program. chatclient will only accept and send messages that are 500 charachters 
	in length. Any excess charachters will be discarded.

	chatclient has been included with a makefile. There are a couple options for building and running. 
	From within chatclients directory use the foolowing.

	To only build chatclient:  make

	      To run after build:  ./chatclient [HOST] [PORT]
	                 Example:  ./chatclient localhost 30021

	To build and run at once:  make run HOSTNAME=[HOST] PORT=[PORT]
	                 Example:  make run HOSTNAME=localhost PORT=30021

	To remove chatclient.exe:  make clean
